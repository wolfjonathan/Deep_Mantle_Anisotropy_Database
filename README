README

grid_files contains gridded deep mantle anisotropy locations sorted by splitting methods (subfolders)
Grids are regularly spaced in terms of lat-lon. Spacing is 0.5x0.5 degrees. The columns of the *.txt files are: longitude / 째, latitude / 째.

contour_files contains all deep mantle anisotropy contour files sorted by splitting methods (subfolders). The columns of the *.txt files are: longitude / 째, latitude / 째, irrelevant.

plot_with_gmt contains GMT plotting scripts for all grid files.
