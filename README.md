# Deep_Mantle_Anisotropy_Database
Global digital database of deep mantle anisotropy locations

grid_files contains gridded deep mantle anisotropy locations sorted by splitting methods (subfolders)
Grids are regularly spaced in terms of lat-lon. Spacing is 0.5x0.5 degrees.

contour_files contains all deep mantle anisotropy contour files sorted by splitting methods (subfolders)

plot_with_gmt contains GMT plotting scripts for all grid files.
